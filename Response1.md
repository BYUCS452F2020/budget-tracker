## Why I am interested
    I have often found myself starting to organize my budget (i.e. in Excel) but encountering too many relationships to organize it properly. As such I try alternative options but am never satisfied. I think an organized backend with solid database management and simple API is where to start for my budget tracking.

    Perhaps incomes and expenses could simply be combined into a transaction with credit and debit attributes. Credits would typically be positive, but negative values could be used for corrections. This could more easily distinguish between income corrections vs. normal expensives and vice versa.
    
    Also users tend to have credit cards, savings accounts, checking accounts etc. so accounts could be tracked as well and associated with the relevant transactions and budget categories.
    
    I don't know anything about PostgreSQL, but if it's anything like SQLite either one would be great to use for the relational approach. I've also worked with DynamoDB and MongoDB before and would be happy to use either for the noSQL approach.
