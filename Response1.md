## Why I am interested
I have often found myself starting to organize my budget (i.e. in Excel) but encountering too many relationships to organize it properly. As such I try alternative options but am never satisfied. I think an organized backend with solid database management and simple API is where to start for my budget tracking.

## How I want to contribute
I'd like to keep the front-end as minimal as possible to ensure time is spent on a solid back-end product. Ideally I'd contribute first by cooperatively designing both the Database Model and API as a team. Second, I'd like to split up the budget application's operations between team members for initial implementation, but to share in the process of editing/debugging/refactoring across all operations after the initial implementation.

## Business
An open source project sounds great.

## Legal
An open source license sounds great.

## Technical
Perhaps incomes and expenses could simply be combined into a transaction model with credit and debit attributes. Credits would typically be positive, but negative values could be used for corrections. This could more easily distinguish between income corrections vs. normal expenses and likewise for positive debits.
    
Users tend to have credit cards, savings accounts, checking accounts etc. so accounts could be tracked in the application as well and associated with the relevant transactions and budget categories.
    
I don't know anything about PostgreSQL, but if it is anything like SQLite either one would be great to use for the relational approach. I've also worked with DynamoDB and MongoDB before and would be happy to use either for the noSQL approach.
