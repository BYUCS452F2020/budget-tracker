# Balance: Budgeting app
Balance (final name could change) is a zero-based budgeting system that allows a user to add incomes as well as plan and track their expenses.

## Team
I am looking for 1-2 other teammates to join this project.

## Relational Database
The project will likely use PostgreSQL or SQLite with ~4 tables to start (users, incomes, expenses, expense_categories).

## NoSQL Database
We will also use a NoSQL document database; likely MongoDB or DynamoDB.

## Business
This will begin as an open source project for free use for whomever wants to keep better track of their finances.

## Legal
We will have to obtain an open source license for our project to determine under which conditions our software can be used or modified.

## Technical
The following outline represents the major steps for this project
* Design and create the database tables and schemas (relational & NoSQL)
* Design and build a backend API to handle business logic of budgeting transactions, such as creating an expense category or adding a new income (likely in Kotlin or possibly some other JVM language such as Java)
* Build a simple authentication layer for different user accounts (likely with JWT)
* Build a simple mobile (Android) or web (React) client for a user to view and update their personal budget
